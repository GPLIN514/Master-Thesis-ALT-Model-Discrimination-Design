# Model Discrimination Design Generation for Accelerated Life Testing Experiments via Hybridized Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains the complete code and supplementary materials for my master's thesis titled:

**"Model Discrimination Design in Accelerated Life Testing Based on Divergence Measures"**

## 📄 Thesis
The full thesis PDF is available in this repository under `Thesis.pdf`.

## 📦 Contents

- `R_Simulation_Code/`:  
  R scripts used for simulation studies presented in the thesis, including:
  - Main simulation scenarios
  - Model configuration and divergence functions
  - Code for Appendix B examples

- `Shiny_App/`:  
  A fully interactive Shiny application allowing users to:
  - Choose between Fidalgo, Arrhenius, and Meeker models
  - Select divergence criteria (CKL, CLW, CB, Chi-square)
  - Customize design space and view optimal designs and plots

## 🔧 Requirements

- R (>= 4.2.0)
- R packages:  
  `shiny`, `shinyjs`, `ggplot2`, `DiscrimOD`, `DT`, `Rcpp`, `RcppArmadillo`
